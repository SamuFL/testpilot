target_url: "https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist/"

preconditions:
  - "Browser is open with a clean session (no existing todos)"

site_context:
  - "TodoMVC is a single-page app. The text input at the top adds new todos on Enter."
  - "To edit an existing todo, double-click its label — it turns into an editable input."
  - "While editing, press Enter to save or Escape to cancel."
  - "Each todo has a delete ('×') button on the right that only appears on hover."
  - "The footer shows the count of remaining active items."

steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Open https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist/ and verify the app loads with an empty list."
    expected: "The TodoMVC React app loads. The 'What needs to be done?' input is visible. No todos are listed."

  - step: 2
    action: "Type 'Read a book' into the new todo input and press Enter."
    expected: "A todo item 'Read a book' appears in the list. The counter shows '1 item left'."

  - step: 3
    action: "Type 'Go for a run' into the new todo input and press Enter."
    expected: "A second todo item 'Go for a run' appears. The counter shows '2 items left'."

  - step: 4
    action: "Double-click the label of 'Read a book' to start editing it. Clear the current text and type 'Read two books', then press Enter to save."
    expected: "The todo item now reads 'Read two books'. The list still shows 2 items. The counter still shows '2 items left'."

  - step: 5
    action: "Hover over 'Go for a run' to reveal its delete button, then click the '×' delete button."
    expected: "'Go for a run' is removed from the list. Only 'Read two books' remains. The counter shows '1 item left'."
